No deaths have been reported outside China.\nResearchers at a specialist lab in Melbourne, Australia, said they were able to grow a copy of the virus from an infected patient. The sample was sent to them last Friday.\n\"We've planned for an incident like this for many, many years and that's really why we were able to get an answer so quickly,\" said Dr Mike Catton of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51289897"}
